# Brand Analyst Findings

I have completed the diagnostics for all brands and competitor brands mentioned in the tasks. Below is the detailed analysis per task:

1. Rachael Ray Nutrish across PCB categories:
- Dry Dog Total: Sales declined by $289,849 in the last 4 weeks (L4) compared to previous 4 weeks (P4), driven slightly more by volume decline (51.5%) than price decline (47.4%). Total traffic and Buy Box rate decreased, indicating less shopper visits and reduced buy box control. Paid ad spend decreased in L4. Competitors Purina Pro Plan and Blue Buffalo also declined in L4 but grew vs Y4.
- Wet Cat Total: Sales almost flat with a slight decline of $28,598 L4 vs P4, driven mainly by volume decline (97.5%) despite positive price effect. Total traffic and Buy Box rate decreased. Paid ad spend increased significantly in L4. Key competitor Fancy Feast had a 4.5% sales decline in L4 but strong growth Y4.
- Dog Treats Total: Slight sales decline by $22,115 L4, driven mostly by volume drop (123.9%). Total traffic decreased heavily. Paid ad spend increased. Key competitor Full Moon showed a 13.8% sales decline L4.
- Dry Cat Total: Small sales decline of $13,343 L4, mostly from volume drop. Total traffic increased slightly. Paid ad spend increased. Competitors like Iams and Science Diet showed mixed results.
- Cat Treats Total: Sales declined by about $103,969 L4, driven roughly evenly by price and volume decline. Total traffic rose slightly. Paid ad spend increased. Key competitors like Beneful declined while Science Diet increased.
- Wet Dog Total: Sales decline of $456,589 L4 vs P4, driven mostly by volume decline (115%). Total traffic decreased. Paid ad spend and Buy Box rate decreased. Competitors showed declines, but Blue Buffalo had a smaller dip.

Overall, Rachael Ray Nutrish shows a common pattern of short-term sales decline primarily driven by volume loss, coupled with decreased traffic and mixed pricing effects across categories. Paid ad spend was uneven but generally increased.

2. Nature's Recipe performance:
- Dry Dog Total: Sales declined by $1,744,399 L4, mainly volume-driven with a 64.3% contribution. Traffic decreased slightly, and ad spend increased. Buy Box rate was stable. Major competitors like Purina Pro Plan and Blue Buffalo declined in sales but saw growth year-over-year.
- Wet Dog Total: Sales also declined by $1,040,371 in L4, again volume was main factor (126%). Traffic dropped significantly despite some increase in ad spend. Buy Box rate remained at zero.
- Other Dog Total: Sales decline by $351,057 in L4, driven mostly by price effect (257%) and volume decline. Traffic slightly decreased, ad spend decreased. Competitors showed mixed performance with some strong category contributors.

Nature's Recipe experienced significant volume-driven sales declines across major dog categories, combined with traffic decreases and uneven ad spend.

3. 9Lives in Wet Cat, Dry Cat and Cat Treats:
- Wet Cat: Sales decline of $22,854 L4 driven mostly by volume drop (119%). Traffic slightly increased. Ad spend steady at zero. Buy Box rate decreased slightly.
- Dry Cat: Sales decline of $13,869 L4 mostly volume-driven. Traffic increased. Paid ad spend increased. Buy Box rate stabilized.
- Cat Treats: Sales saw a big decline of $1.7M driven mostly by volume loss but with some price recovery. Traffic and Buy Box rate fluctuated with modest ad spend.

9Lives had mixed but generally negative sales performance in all three categories, largely driven by volume loss with few signs of traffic growth or promotional leverage.

4. Kibbles 'n Bits in Dry Dog and Wet Dog:
- Dry Dog Total: Sales increased by $74,740 L4, driven mostly by volume growth (75%). Traffic and Buy Box rate increased. Paid ad spend was zero.
- Wet Dog Total: Sales very stable with minor decline or flat sales. Volume slightly positive in L4, traffic increased. Buy Box rate improved marginally.

Kibbles 'n Bits shows some recovery and growth in Dry Dog category, but overall flat dynamics in Wet Dog.

5. Major competitor brands:
- Purina Pro Plan (Dry Dog Total) had a sales decline of 7.1% L4 vs P4 but grew 19.4% Y4, contributing 66.9% of category change; competitor remains dominant despite short-term dip.
- Fancy Feast (Wet Cat Total) down 4.5% L4 vs P4 but up 9.0% Y4, contributing massively (1112.3%) to category change; strong long-term growth despite short-term dip.
- Blue Buffalo (Dry Dog Total) down 3.1% L4 vs P4, small 1.7% Y4 growth, contributing 19.0%; some softness in short term.
- Full Moon (Dog Treats Total) down 13.8% L4, but 20.2% growth Y4, contribution 142%; strong long-term performance.
- Friskies (Wet Cat Total) down slightly (-2.8%) L4 but up 26.3% Y4, contribution 375.3%; strong category player improving overall.

6. Category and competitive insights:
- Competitor brands show overall stronger year-over-year growth despite recent short-term declines.
- Internal brand short-term decline mainly volume-driven, coinciding with decreased traffic and fluctuating advertising spend.
- Buy Box rate changes are mixed but at times decreasing for key internal brands.
- Competitors such as Purina Pro Plan and Fancy Feast continue to dominate category contribution, highlighting competitive pressures.

Summary:
Rachael Ray Nutrish and Nature's Recipe face short-term volume declines across core categories with decreased shopper traffic and mixed ad investment, while competitor brands, including Purina Pro Plan, Fancy Feast, and Blue Buffalo, maintain strong year-over-year growth despite recent dips. 9Lives suffers volume-driven declines in cat categories. Kibbles 'n Bits shows slight recovery in dry dog. Advertising and Buy Box control need strategic focus to support volume recovery amid competitive pressure. Competitor brand strength is a major factor influencing category movements.
