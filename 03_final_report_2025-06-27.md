# Weekly Business Review: Amazon Pet Food Category and PCB Brand Performance

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Key Insights

- The Total Pet supercategory on Amazon is experiencing a short-term sales decline (~$4.08M less than prior 4 weeks) but remains on a strong long-term growth trajectory (+$70M vs last year), highlighting volatility amid steady category expansion.
- Our flagship brand, **Rachael Ray Nutrish**, along with **Nature's Recipe** and **9Lives**, show consistent short-term volume-driven sales declines across nearly all dog and cat segments due to decreased shopper traffic, diminished Buy Box control, and suboptimal advertising allocation.
- **Kibbles 'n Bits** is an outlier with positive volume growth in Dry Dog and flat to stable sales in Wet Dog, signaling a modest recovery potential in targeted categories.
- Key competitors like **Purina Pro Plan**, **Fancy Feast**, and **Blue Buffalo** exhibit short-term softness but sustain strong year-over-year gains, leveraging dominant category presence and likely more effective traffic capture.
- The combination of decreased traffic, fragmented ad spend, and Buy Box rate losses pose a critical internal challenge to volume recovery and defending market share against well-resourced competitors.
- Strategic recalibration of advertising investment, aggressive Buy Box reclamation, and focused shopper engagement initiatives are needed to arrest volume decline and exploit the overall category growth momentum.

## 2. Category Health & Market Dynamics

The Amazon pet food category is navigating a nuanced performance landscape. While recent weeks show a sales dip when benchmarked sequentially, the broader annual trend confirms robust consumer demand and category expansion. This signals episodic market disruptions—potentially driven by seasonality, supply chain dynamics, or competitive activity—rather than structural decline.

Key market forces at work include:

- **Competitive Intensity:** Dominant vet-recommended and premium brands like Purina Pro Plan and Fancy Feast maintain strong shopper loyalty and broad visibility, buffering short-term sales impact.
- **Shopper Behavior:** Reduced traffic to our internal brand listings is a pronounced factor in declining sales volume, indicating eroding shopper engagement or discovery.
- **Amazon Platform Mechanics:** Buy Box control volatility directly correlates with lost sales opportunities. Brands unable to secure or maintain favorable Buy Box rates risk ceding volume to competitors.
- **Marketing Effectiveness:** Advertising spend patterns are inconsistent; some brands show increased spend with traffic drops, suggesting diminishing returns or inefficiencies.
- **Category Fragmentation:** Declines in multiple segments (dry, wet, treats) highlight the need for tailored strategies per product line versus one-size-fits-all approaches.

In summary, the environment is growth-oriented but fiercely competitive, demanding strategic focus on traffic generation, Buy Box dominance, and marketing ROI.

## 3. Deep Dive: Our Brands vs. The Competition

### Rachael Ray Nutrish

Rachael Ray Nutrish faces volume-led sales declines across all key categories:

- Dry Dog sales dropped by $289K driven 51.5% by volume loss.
- Wet Dog saw a more severe $457K decline with 115% volume contraction.
- Cat segments also experienced declines, with Treats down by $104K.

Key drivers:

- Declines in total shopper traffic and ad-driven visits.
- Reduced Buy Box rate, limiting prime shopper access.
- Although paid ad spend increased unevenly — notably in Wet Cat and Treats — this did not translate to volume growth, implying inefficiency or targeting issues.

Our brand struggles to convert advertising and listing visibility into sustained sales, lagging behind competitors in shopper acquisition and retention.

### Nature's Recipe

Nature’s Recipe shows steeper volume declines than Nutrish:

- Dry Dog dropped by $1.7M primarily due to 64.3% volume decline.
- Wet Dog sales fell by $1M with over 126% volume impact.
- Buy Box rate remained stable but at zero in Wet Dog, signaling listing visibility or eligibility issues.

Traffic declines persist despite some increase in ad spend, reflecting poor conversion or marketplace competitive positioning.

### 9Lives

9Lives continues a challenging downward trajectory with severe volume losses causing sales drops:

- Cat Treats category suffered a $1.7M loss.
- Volume declines in Wet Cat and Dry Cat (~119% and substantial decline respectively) outstripped modest price improvements.
- Steady or zero ad spend and declining Buy Box rates prevented traffic leverage.

The brand’s limited promotional activity and reduced Buy Box presence exacerbate declines.

### Kibbles 'n Bits

Kibbles ‘n Bits bucks the overall category trend with positive momentum in Dry Dog:

- Achieved $75K sales growth driven largely by volume increase (75%).
- Increased traffic and Buy Box control without paid advertising.
- Wet Dog sales appear stable with slight volume and Buy Box improvements.

This performance suggests strategic opportunities in Kibbles ‘n Bits leveraging organic visibility and potentially minimal ad investments.

### Competitor Brands

- **Purina Pro Plan:** Though down 7.1% L4, retains category dominance with 19.4% Y4 growth, showing resilience and shopper pull.
- **Fancy Feast:** Minor short-term dip of 4.5% but massive 9% annual growth and outsized contribution to category changes.
- **Blue Buffalo:** Slight recent decline (3.1%) but steady long-term growth.
- **Full Moon:** Significant short-term dip but posted strong annual growth of 20.2%.
- **Friskies:** Short-term sales down by 2.8% but sustained 26.3% growth Y4.

Competitors capitalize on consistent shopper engagement, aggressive advertising, and dominant Buy Box control to maintain solid category share despite periodic declines. Their ability to drive consistent traffic and capture prime Amazon placement remains a clear advantage.

## 4. Actionable Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Reignite Buy Box Ownership Across Core PCB Brands**

- **Why:** Buy Box rate decreases strongly align with volume declines for Rachael Ray Nutrish, Nature’s Recipe, and 9Lives. Buy Box loss directly limits shopper conversion and sales velocity.
- **Outcome:** Restoring Buy Box dominance will secure our prime sales channel on Amazon, arrest volume losses, and create a foundation for growth even amid competitive pressures.

### 2. **Optimize and Refocus Advertising Spend on High-ROI Segments**

- **Why:** Increased ad spend in several categories did not prevent sales declines, indicating poor spend efficiency, targeting, or message alignment.
- **Outcome:** Streamlining ad budgets to focus on segments with growth potential (e.g., Kibbles ‘n Bits Dry Dog) and leveraging data-driven targeting will increase traffic and sales conversions, improving marketing ROI.

### 3. **Enhance Shopper Traffic via Content Refresh and Promotion Innovation**

- **Why:** Decreased shopper traffic is a central driver of volume declines. Current listing content and promotional tactics may lack compelling differentiation versus competitors like Purina and Fancy Feast.
- **Outcome:** Investing in enhanced digital content, including video and user reviews, plus exploring time-limited promotions or subscription discounts, will improve shopper engagement and repeat purchase rates.

### 4. **Leverage Kibbles 'n Bits Growth Momentum as a Model**

- **Why:** Kibbles 'n Bits demonstrates possibility for volume gains with zero ad spend but improved Buy Box and traffic.
- **Outcome:** Applying learnings from Kibbles 'n Bits on pricing strategy, organic traffic optimization, and cross-category synergies can accelerate recovery in stagnant PCB brands.

# Summary

The Amazon pet food category’s overall growth masks underlying short-term disruptions that primarily impact PCB’s core brands—Rachael Ray Nutrish, Nature’s Recipe, and 9Lives—via volume loss from diminished traffic and Buy Box control. Competitive brands’ continued long-term growth highlights the urgent need for PCB to realign advertising investment, aggressively reclaim prime Amazon visibility, and re-engage shoppers through innovative content and promotions. Kibbles ‘n Bits’ growth trajectory provides a roadmap for operational focus and pragmatic brand recovery.

Immediate, coordinated action across these fronts will help harness the upward category trend, regain lost volume, and strengthen PCB’s competitive positioning on Amazon.
